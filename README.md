# Fork Specific Notes
This is a fork of Phazervile: https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville

I am the author of the Handsaw, Bungverb, Reverb, and RadioMusic audio applets.

## How To Hack It

[### Option 1: Platform IO](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
This firmware fork is primarily built using Platform IO, a Python-based build toolchain, available as either a [standalone CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/methods/installer-script.html) or a [full-featured IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide), as well as a plugin for VSCode and other existing IDEs. Follow one of those links to get that set up first.

The PlatformIO project for the source code lives within the `software/` directory. From there, you can Build the desired configuration and Upload via USB to your module. In the terminal, I type:
```
pio run -e T41_audio -t upload
```
Or, for older Teensy 3.2 modules:
```
pio run -e T32 -t upload
```
Or use `T40` for Teensy 4.0. Have a look inside `platformio.ini` for alternative build environment configurations and app flags.

_**Pro-tip**_: If you decide to fork the project, and enable GitHub Actions on your own repo, GitHub will build the files for you... ;)

### Option 2: Arduino IDE
Instead of Platform IO, you can use the latest version of the Arduino IDE + Teensyduino extension. The newer 2.x series should work, no need to install an old version.

Simply open the `software/src/src.ino` file. In the Tools menu, select the appropriate Teensy Board for your hardware; use the "Optimize -> Smallest Code" and "USB Type -> MIDI" options.

Customize Apps and other flags inside `software/src/OC_options.h`. You can also disable individual applets in `software/src/hemisphere_config.h`.

For Teensy 4.1, you'll need a copy of my forked playback library in your local sketchbook folder. Inside the `Arduino/libararies` directory: `git clone https://github.com/djphazer/teensy-variable-playback.git`

This is a fork of [Benisphere Suite](https://github.com/benirose/O_C-BenisphereSuite) which is a fork of [Hemisphere Suite](https://github.com/Chysn/O_C-HemisphereSuite) by Jason Justian (aka Chysn / [Beige Maze](https://soundcloud.com/beige-maze)).

ornament**s** & crime**s** was a collaborative firmware project by Patrick Dowling (aka **pld**), mxmxmx, and Tim Churches (aka **bennelong.bicyclist**), considerably extending the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by **mxmxmx**.
